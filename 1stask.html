          <h2>KARGIL WAR HERO</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Capt Vijayant Thapar</b> (26 December 1976 – 27 July 2015) was born in a military 
            family to Colonel V N Thapar and Mrs Tripta Thapar. Having brought up in the army family Capt Thapar always wanted 
            to follow in the footsteps of his father. In his childhood, he would often play with a gun and march around wearing his 
            father’s peak cap and holding his cane like an officer. He pursued his dream and worked hard to get selected in <b>IMA Dehradun</b>. 
            He did exceedingly well in his training and was commissioned into the <b>Army Service Corps</b>, the logistic arm of the <b>Indian Army</b>.

            Capt Vijayant’s was posted to serve with <b>2 Rajputana Rifles</b> an infantry battalion as his first assignment which was at Gwalior 
            in 1998. He stayed there for a month before the unit moved to Kashmir to undertake anti-insurgency operations. Capt Vijayant was 
            always fond of outdoor activities and in the evening would invariably be in the Paltan (Battalion), watching wrestlers, boxers, 
            and other sportsmen.  As a person, he was very kindhearted, considerate and frugal. He took to religion early in his life and wanted 
            to live the life of a Puritan. He maintained a balanced diet and worked hard in the gym in order to be fit. In 1999, Capt Vijyant was 
            involved in two fierce encounters. While talking to his mother on the telephone he described how he lived through a live encounter in 
            which about thirty bullets were fired at him. Later his unit was tasked to move to Drass in Kargil sector to undertake operations against 
            Pak forces who had occupied <b>Tololing, Tiger Hill, and adjoining heights</b>.
